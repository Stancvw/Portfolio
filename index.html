            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As someone who loves computers and math, I've always wanted to get into the programming industry.</p>
            <br>
            <p> As a father of five, I've worked countless blue-collar jobs to take care of my family. I've
                learned many things
                about customer service, problem-solving, and team-leading. Now that I have an opportunity to pursue a
                career I'd be passionate
                about, I'm excited to join a team of like-minded developers. I think my past experiences will prove
                useful not only in coding but in
                working with others to solve problems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I'm attending a coding boot camp by the name of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>. My true passion lies in video games, and I'm hoping this career choice
                will lead me down the path of video game design.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of programming, I have a few different hobbies. Most of my time is dedicated to my family - I
                love spending time with my kids. When I'm not busy with that, I'm usually playing video games or reading
                a good book.</p>
